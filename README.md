# Sudoku Game with MongoDB and User Authentication 

## Project Overview
A Pygame-based Sudoku game built as a learning project to explore databases and user authentication. The application combines classic Sudoku gameplay with MongoDB for storing user data and high scores, using bcrypt for secure password handling.

## Tech Stack
- **Game Engine**: Pygame
- **Backend**: Python
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: bcrypt
- **Libraries**: pymongo, random, time

## Key Features

### User Authentication
- User registration and login system
- Password hashing with bcrypt for enhanced security

### Game Features
- Generating a classic 9x9 Sudoku grid
- GUI for easy gameplay/controls
- Score tracking based on completion time and mistakes 

### Database Integration
- MongoDB integration for storing user data and highscores
- Secure storage of user passwords

## What I Learned

### Database Management
- Working with MongoDB:
  - Connecting to databases
  - Managing collections
  - Performing operations (insert, find, sort)
  - Storing and retrieving user data

### Authentication & Security
- Implementing secure user authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Protecting sensitive user data

### Game Development
- Building interactive games with Pygame
- Handling user input
- Implementing game logic
- Creating a responsive user interface

## Future Improvements
- Add different difficulty levels
- Implement game state saving to resume progress
- Highscore leaderboard system
- Add sound effects and background music
- Create a more polished user interface
